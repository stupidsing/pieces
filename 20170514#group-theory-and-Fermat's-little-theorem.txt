== Group (G, @)

1) x, y belongs to G => xy  belongs to G (closure)
2) x(yz) = (xy)z (associative)
3) there exists e belongs to G such that ex = x = xe for all x belongs to G
4) for any x belongs to G, there exists x^-1 belongs to G such that xx^-1 = e = x^-1x (inverse)

subgroup: H C G is a subgroup if H is also a group under the same operation.

Example: Z = set of all integers
2Z = set of all even integers
(Z, +) is a group and (2Z, +) is a subgroup of (Z, +).

Example: Z can be divided into modulo classes for any positive integer n.
For any X belongs to {0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1}
[x] = {y belongs to Z: x == y mod n}
= {x + kn: k belongs to Z}

Define the set of modulo classes
{[x]: x=0, 1, ..., n - 1} = G
G is a finite set and G has n elements.
We can define + and @ in G as follows:
[x] + [y] = [x + y]
[x][y] = [xy]

Then (G, +, @) is a ring.
note that (G, +) is a group, identity is e = [0] = [n] and inverse of [x] is [-x].

== Field

(F, +, @) is a field if (F, +) is a group and (F\{0}, @) is also a group
i.e. every non-zero (not the additive identity) has multiplicative inverse.
(Notation: 0 = additive identity, 1 = multiplicative identity.)

Example:
For n = positive integer, G = {[x]: x belongs to Z}
(G, +, @) is only a ring but may not be a field because [x] may not have an inverse.

Actually [x] has an inverse if and only if x and n are relatively prime to each other.

when n = p, a prime number then (G, +, @) is a field because [x] has an inverse for any [x] != [0] (x is not a multiple of n)

Suppose now (F, +, @) is a field.
So (F, +) is a group (additive)
and if 0 is the additive identity, (F\{0}, @) is also a group (multiplicative)
Suppose also F has a finite number of elements, say |F| = q,
we shall show that
for any x belongs to F, x != 0 => x^(q - 1) = 1, the multiplicative inverse of F.

Reason:
We need the so-called Lagrange theorem:
If H C G is a subgroup of G then |H| is a factor of |G|.
We first assume this theorem is correct.

Next we consider the following set for x belongs to F (x != 0)
K = {x^k: k belongs to Z} C F
(x^0 = 1 by definition)
K is finite as we assume that |F| = q is finite.

Also it is not difficult to see that K is a subgroup of (F\{0}, @)
Actually x^0 = 1, inverse of x^k is x^-k.
(By Lagrange theorem |K| is a factor of |F\{0}| = q - 1)

Now suppose |K| = t
so K = {1 = x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., x^(t - 1)}
and x^t must be 1! (why? can be see?)

Now it is a factor of q - 1, HAHA
so x^(q - 1) = 1 too!

Conclusion:
===========

(F, +, @) is a field and |F| = q => x^(q - 1) = 1 for all x != 0.
Now we can prove Fermat's Little Theorem for the previous (G, +, @) with n = p, a prime number
|G| = p and so for any x belongs to {1, 2, ..., p - 1} we have x^(p - 1) = 1
i.e. x^(p - 1) == 1 (mod p)
HAHAHA.
